Ant Colony Optimisation of the bin packing problem

## ACO

The Bin-Packing Problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. The objective is to equally distribute items of different weights into a finite set of bins. Due to its combinatorial complexity, it is impractical to solve for optimal solutions and hence computational approximations are better suited, especially for larger instances of the problem. This paper explores the growing field of nature-inspired solutions applied to Bin Packing. The paper then focuses on Ant Colony Optimisation as a heuristic approach to Bin Packing by trans- forming the problem to finding the best path through a weighted graph. It then highlights the limitations of this model before attempting to solve them with the Max-Min Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm.
